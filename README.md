This is all the material for the Wix NodeJS Workshop, 
first conducted on the 6th of March, 2016.

# Setup Instructions
1. Install Node v5 (currently v5.8.0)
1. Install git
1. `$ git clone https://github.com/wix/node-workshop.git`
1. `$ cd node-workshop`
1. `$ npm install` (this takes a while)
1. To test your setup, run `$ npm test`. This will test all the code
   that is used in the workshop, including the solved exercises

# Setup Visual Studio Code (optional, but recommended)
If you prefer another IDE (IntelliJ/Eclipse/WebStore), 
or just want to use Notepad/Vim/Emacs, feel free to do so. But
if you don't know which one you want, 
then we would recommend Visual Studio Code.

1. Install Visual Studio Code
1. Install "typings": `$ npm install -g typings`
1. Install Intellisense for Node: `$ typings install node express --ambient`

# What's In This Repository?
This repository has 3 parts:
* [Tutorial](01-tutorial-code/README.md): this includes fully functioning
  (and tested!) programs that demonstrate all the things we learn about. This is 
  _exactly_ the code that will be shown by the instructor in the first half
  of the workshop.
* [Exercises](02-exercises/README.md): this is the part where you get to write
  code. See below for more information on the exercises.
* [Solved Exercises](03-solved-exercises/README.md): this contains the same
  exercise as in the previous part, but "solved" and runnable. This is
  reference information in case you really really can't figure it out. 

# Instructions for the Exercises
* Can be found in [the exercises folder](02-exercises/README.md).
* Should be read carefully. You don't need to read them all at once,
  but the introduction is important, and the per-exercise information
  can be read before each exercise.
